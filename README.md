# Pig Game

### Tech stack: HTML | CSS | JS

'Pig Game' is a dynamic website for the two-player dice game. Each player takes turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. Players can hold their score, but beware of rolling a '1' as it ends their turn. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

#### Project Structure:

The project includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and images folder.

#### Main Page:

The website features a single-page layout with a centrally placed game board, divided in half for two players. A rolled dice is displayed in the middle. Also, there are buttons for restart, roll and hold. The total score for each player is written above, and the current score for each trial is written below. Rolling a '1' resets the current score and switches the active player. In case of hold, the points accumulated on the current score section are added to the total score. A success message appears when a player reaches 100 points.
